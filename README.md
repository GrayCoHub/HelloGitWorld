First Git in Making a Better Understanding of the Overall GitHub Thing 0930

Second message 1000 - This Readme file was first created in the GitHub website.  I later created a directory on my PC using the GitShell.  I'm not exactly what was included in this directory.

Then I tried to pass info to the GibHub website from my PC using the GitShell  - no sucess.

Then I went back into the GitHub website and "downloaded" that Git back to my PC.  This file was included with that download.  

The theory is I'm now updating this file - which will then need to be resent to the GitHub website.

1010	I did not need to resend this file to GitHub.  After I saved the file it was automatically updated at GitHub showing "1 Change"

I will save this file again with this updated note.  I expect GitHub will have 2 changes showing.
